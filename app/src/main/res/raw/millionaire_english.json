Each punched card corresponded to a specific row of the pattern, and as the loom passed each row, it read the holes in the card to determine which warp threads should be lifted and which should be lowered.\nThis system allowed for the production of intricate patterns that were previously only achievable through labor-intensive manual weaving.

These plates and spikes likely served a defensive purpose, either as a means of discouraging predators or for intraspecific combat.\nStegosaurus had a small head with a beak-like mouth for biting off plant material. It had a relatively small brain compared to its body size and was not known for its intelligence. Despite this, Stegosaurus was a successful herbivore, and its fossils have been found in several locations around the world, including North America, Europe, and Asia.",
